-i wrote out the logistic regression class and tested it 
-i created simple variables and a simple function to test with
-i created a cost function and a gradient function
-I created a simple logistic regression class. The parts int's initiallized with weights and bias matrix, prediciton
-there is a cost function which in this cass is the negative log loss. 
-i created some fake datapoints and performed a linear regression on them. paramters, cost function, updates

-thte gradient is not computing it's asking for ndims to be 0 but classifier.l1 is 2 
-taking out the regularization. ill try to put it in later
-took out hidden layar params to see if it will work
